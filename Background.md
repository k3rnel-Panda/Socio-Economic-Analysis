> In order to better understand the level of development in the various districts of Odisha, we have to be familiar with the concept of socio-economic parameters. After dwelling in some research on the topic, I believe that the most influential parameters are as follows:
> 
>  1. Health
>  2. Agriculture 
>  3. Literacy Rate
>  4. Employment Rate


**Importing the necessary packages:**

>import pandas as pd
